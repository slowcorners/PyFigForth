# PyFigFORTH

A (very much experimental!) virtual Fig-FORTH machine coded in Python. I have no idea whether the end result will have any value at all, even for myself, but I cannot refrain from trying to build a small FORTH system for testing.

The target (read: dream) is that the final system will support both FORTH screen based disk storage as well as compiling of FORTH code from external text files.

I will try to stick to the Fig model as well as I can. - Hmm... maybe with some exceptions regarding True/False flags and logical/bit operators.

Time will tell...
